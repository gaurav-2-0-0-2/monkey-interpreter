## Some notes:
#### Chapter 2: Writing a parser**
- There are two types of parsers: top-down and bottom-up.
- Recursive descent parsing, early parsing or predictive parsing are variations of top-down parsing.
- The parser that I wrote is a ***recursive descent parser***.
    - It is sometoimes also called **Pratt parser**, 
    - It is "top-down operator precedence"
